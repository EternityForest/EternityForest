- 👋 Hi, I’m @EternityForest
- 👀 I’m interested in: Software that just works, no hacking and manual setup needed.  I think FOSS has a 
     lot to learn from commercial software and I'm trying to help make that happen!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Micropython!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: IoT, entertainment, or anything that really makes a difference
- 📫 How to reach me: Let's try out this GitHub Discussions thing!
